        <p>
          Fatal incidents involving law enforcement officers in the United
          States are a significant concern. Congress requested data on police
          use of force in 1994, but it was never compiled, and the FBI doesn't
          collect this information. Recent estimates indicate an annual range of
          930 to 1,240 justifiable homicides, with police shootings being a
          leading cause of death for men aged 25‚Äì29. Two databases,
          <span class="custom-highlight">'The Counted'</span> by The Guardian
          and <span class="custom-highlight">The Washington Post</span>,
          recorded these incidents from 2015 to 2019. In 2019, The Washington
          Post reported 1,004 police shooting fatalities, totaling 6,600 since
          2015, primarily affecting men.

          database. We'll explore case distribution by state, identify cities
          with the highest incidence, analyze age and race demographics, assess
          weapons used, and present an annual case trend.

        <h1>Victim Analysis</h1>
        <p>
          The distribution of victims' ages exhibits a pronounced
          <strong>right-skew</strong>, with a predominant age range spanning
          from <span class="custom-highlight">20 to 40 years</span>.
          Additionally, there is a notable presence of older victims, reflecting
          a diverse age range.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="custom-highlight">Male victims</span> significantly
          outnumber their female counterparts, constituting a staggering
          <span class="custom-highlight">94.97%</span> of the total victims,
          totaling <span class="custom-highlight">4,815</span>
          cases. Conversely, female victims account for a smaller proportion,
          with a representation of 5.03%, encompassing 255 cases.

          In contrast, <span class="custom-highlight">Black</span> victims make

        <h1>Weapons Used</h1>
        <p>
          The weapon of choice for the majority of victims in these incidents
          was a <span class="custom-highlight">gun</span>, accounting for a
          substantial <span class="custom-highlight">2,987</span> cases.
          Additionally, a significant number of victims resorted to using a
          <span class="custom-highlight">knife</span> as their weapon, tallying
          <span class="custom-highlight">767</span> instances.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 378 recorded instances, victims were found to be unarmed during
          these incidents. Furthermore, other weapons such as toy weapons,
          vehicles, and machetes were also employed, with frequencies of 196,
          173, and 42 occurrences, respectively. Notably, there were 52 cases
          where the weapon used remained unidentified.

          Over time, there has been a significant decline in these occurrences,
          with the highest number of cases documented in 2015 at a staggering
          <span class="custom-highlight">913</span>, while in 2022, the count
          has plummeted to a mere
          <span class="custom-highlight">84</span> cases. This substantial
          reduction could be attributed to various factors such as improved law
          enforcement training, increased public awareness, or changes in
          policing policies.
